<h1> About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Tina, and I'm a Vietnamese girl approaching the age of twenty. I currently attend Interactive Media Design in Ottawa, the capital of the maple leaf region. I've lived in Canada with my family for seven years; we've now become citizens and have a solid existence here. I truly appreciate this free nation because I feel like I can be anyone I want to be here without being limited by myself.
</p>

<p>Reading, viewing films, and listening to music are some of my pastimes. Usually, if I don't have to go to school or work, I'll treat myself to some quiet time, light a candle, switch on a warm study light, and listen to some soothing music while I read the books I have in my hands. I read in a variety of genres, but I frequently discover detective and horror because I find them to be so engrossing that I can't put the book down.
</p>

<h2>Motivational quote</h2>
<blockquote><p> "I once heard that once you enter this planet, you must leave your mark. If you're shallow, at least try to be decent; if you're gifted and accomplished, you must commit your life to serving your nation and your fellow citizens. I'm not sure what I can achieve with my life, but at least I have a role model to aspire to: Full personality, self-control, heart filled with love for one's country and family, and eyes always open to the outside world. My youth is not being wasted if I can develop into such a person." </p><cite>Tina</cite></blockquote>
